The term frequency (TF) is the number of times the word appears in a document. The inverse document frequency (IDF) measures the signficance of the word/term in a entire corpus. \n",

    "##### When comparing the 3 different LDA Model outputs of the topics, I think the LDA model with norm='L2' produces the optimal results.  The key words that it flags just help solidify my previous response and offer more clues to the topic. I think provides more clarity to the topic. For example, L2 - Topic 2 has the word 'canon' and that word with camera easily tells us that the topic has to do cameras. 'L1' does capture this but it also has the word 'garmins' in there and I think that should be in another topic all together. \n",
